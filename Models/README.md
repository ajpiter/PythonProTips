## Types of Models 

#### Before you can begin to create models you need to understand what models are available and which work best for which problems. There have been many books written on the subject, and at somepoint I should probably add my notes to reference later. For now the best quick explination is the visual below.

In addition to my Github notes below are book & online course recommendations for the various models. 

**Machine Learning with Python Cookbook: Practical Solutions from Preprocessing to Deep Learning** Must read chapter 12 on Model Selection and then chapter 11 on Model evaluation.irst 8 chapters devoted to basic Data Wrangling. Then a chapter on each of your common models (Regression, Trees, KNN, Logistic, Bayes, Clustering and NN).

## Supervised Learning 

### Linear Networks (Most Common) 
1. **Practical Statistics for Data Science:** Almost an entire book devoted to regression and linear modeling. Covers concepts you forgot from stats class and how to implement in R or Python. From correlation, to sampling to accessing the model and cross validation.
