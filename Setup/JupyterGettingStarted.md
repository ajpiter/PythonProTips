# Jupyter Basics 
- Cells are in green boxes, and where you will write your code. 
- The play button runs the code in the cell, and displays the output below the cell. 
- Cells get numbered based on when you ran the code.
- Running the cell in markdown mode creates text. 
- Command Palette allows you to search for what you want to do. 
- Any code executed in one cell is available in all other cells
