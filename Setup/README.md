# Setting Up Python 

## Setup Options 
1. Use an online IDE to run Python code such as Repl or Google CoLab. 
2. Download Python directly and use the Terminal to write code
3. Download Python and download an IDE such as Sypder or PyCharm. 
4. Download Anaconda and launch IDE from Anaconda. Including Jupyer, Sypder and PyCharm.  

## 1. Online IDE 

Online web based IDEs can be used on any browser including on tablets and cell phones. Which is helpful for quickly testing a short code snippet. 
Note not all packages will work on all online IDEs, although most of the common packages Numpy etc are supported. 

- [Repl](https://repl.it/languages/python3): Truly a web-based IDE, just go to the website type some code and see your output. 
- [Google CoLab](): Similar to a Jupyter Lab notebook, Colab allows uses to create a notebook with both python and markdown code blocks. Colab is accessed through Google Drive and can be shared for collobration or viewing purposes similarly to other types of Google Docs. 

## 2. Download Python & Use Terminal 
- [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-371/) 
- [Instructions for Getting Started with Terminal](https://dev.to/sloan/explain-the-difference-between-shell-console-terminal-command-line-etc-like-im-five--55cf): Great article explaining the difference between a terminal, shell and command line.  

## 3. Download an IDE 
First you will need to decide which IDE is best for your needs. The most Popular IDE's according to a [2019 DataCamp article:](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/top-python-ides-for-2019) can be found in the image below. 

- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install): Beautiful IDE that allows the mix use of python, and markdown cells. Other languages including R can be used in the same notebook with modifications. Best used through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) but can also be downloaded directly are opened through the terminal. 
- [Sypder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/): Similar setup to RStudio and was designed for Data Science projects. 
- [PyCharm](): Required IDE for tensorflow certification.

## 4. Downlaod Anaconda 
Anaconda allows you to create multiple environments, with each environment having specific Python and package versions. By creating environments in Anaconda you avoid having to mess with installing differnt versions of packages or python for differnt projects. 

- [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
- Anaconda can access Jupyter, Spyder and PyCharm IDEs.
