3. Download Python and download an IDE 
4. Download Anaconda and launch IDE from Anaconda 

## Online IDE 
https://repl.it/languages/python3

Online web based IDEs can be used on any browser including on tablets and cell phones. 
Which is helpful for quickly testing a short code snippet. 
Note not all packages will work on all online IDEs, although most of the common packages Numpy etc are supported.

## Downlaod Anaconda 
Anaconda allows you to create multiple environments, with each environment having specific Python and package versions. 
By creating environments in Anaconda you avoid having to mess with installing differnt versions of packages or python for differnt projects.
