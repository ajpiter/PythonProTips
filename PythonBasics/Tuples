Lists Versus Tuples
Tuples are used to collect an immutable ordered list of elements. This means that:

You can’t add elements to a tuple. There’s no append() or extend() method for tuples,
You can’t remove elements from a tuple. Tuples have no remove() or pop() method,
You can find elements in a tuple since this doesn’t change the tuple.
You can also use the in operator to check if an element exists in the tuple.

So, if you’re defining a constant set of values and all you’re going to do with it is iterate through it, use a tuple instead of a list. 
It will be faster than working with lists and also safer, as the tuples contain “write-protect” data.
