## Creating Lists 

You can create a list of values by putting them in [brackets] and assigning them a variable. 
list = [item1, item2, item3, item4] 

### List Key Concepts 
- **Copying Lists:** Need to copy the values not the reference by using y = list(x) 
- **DataType:** lists can contain any type of value, or multiple value types
- **Indexing Lists:** List index begins with 0 [0, 1, 2, 3] or -1 from the end [-4, -3, -2, -1]
- **Mainpulating Lists:** Changing values, adding additional values or removing values from a list 
- **Slicing Lists:** Control which values of a list you see, uses indexing 
- **Subset Lists:** Use Comparisons to determine which elements of a list to keep 

### Functions for Lists 
- **.append()** Referenced in Mainpulating Lists, add an item to a list.  
- **.extend()** Referenced in Mainpulating Lists, add multiple items to a list. 
- **index()** Referenced in Indexing, look up the index of an element in a list. 
- **.remove()** Referenced in Mainpulating Lists, add remove items in a list.
- **.reverse()** Referenced in Mainpulating Lists, add reverse items in a list.
- **zip()** Referenced in List of Lists, combine two lists into a list of lists
- **zip(x, cycle())** Referenced in List of Lists, iterate values from one list over values in another list
