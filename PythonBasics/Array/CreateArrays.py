#You can create a 2D NumPy Array by 
#variable = np.array([list one], [list two])
variable = np.array([[1,1,1,1,1], [25,26,27,28,29]])

#You could find out the shape of a NumPy array using variable.shape
variable = np.array([[1,1,1,1,1], [25,26,27,28,29]])
variable.shape
# output (2,5) for two rows and five columns of data

#Remember that numPy arrays have to be of the same type (str, list, int, bool etc)
