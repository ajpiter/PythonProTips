## Numpy Array's 

Numpy is a common package used in data science that creates a new data type Numpy Arrays. 
Arrays are similar to lists but allows python to make calculations over the enitre array. 
Arrays can only contain one data type, if you try to use multiple types they are all converted to single type. Often strings or integers. 

### Creating an Numpy Array 

import numpy as np 

NpArray = np.array([87.2, 43.9, 18.73]) 

### Array Concepts 

- **Adding Arrays:** Array addition acts differently than list addition
