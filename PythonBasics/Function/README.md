## Functions 

##### You can call a function instead of rewriting the code yourslef using (). 

### Built in Functions 

Not all functions preform across all data types, and when they do they may preform differently. An easy way to organize built in functions is based on the datatype utilized. 

- **Functions for Lists:** 
- **input()** Allows users to input variables that is then used for a calculation within the function. 

### Writing Functions 

def write_a_book(character, setting, special_skill):
  print(character + " is in " + 
        setting + " practicing her " + 
        special_skill)

write_a_book('Superman', 'Smallville', 'xRayVision') 

### Examples of Functions Written 

- **election_year()** Determines if a given year is an election year. 
- **sayhello()** The hello world of functions
