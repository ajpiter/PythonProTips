## Variables & Dataframes 

#### The building blocks of Python. 
1. **Variable** is a container for storing data. 
2. **Dataframe** a two dimensional labeled data structure. Conceptually think of a spreadsheet. 

## Data Types 

#### Different types of inputs have different behavior in python

1. **Floats:** Real numbers include decimals 
2. **Intergers:** Whole counting numbers  
3. **String:** Text surrounded by "quotes"
4. **Boolean:** is True or False 
5. **Lists:** A collection of values stored as List = ['a', 'b', 'c'] or ListOfList = [(1, 2, 3), ('a', 'b', 'c')]
6. **Dictionary:** Uses keys to reference values, {'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3} 
7. **Numpy Array:** Similar to a list but must be one data type. Allows for calculations over entire array. 
8. **Set:** 
9. **Tuples:**

## Functions & Loops 

#### Common commands that make executing code easier. 
1. **Functions:** A block of code that preforms a specific task  
2. **Loops:** Iterate over a dictionary, list, tuple, set or string. 
3. **Conditional Statements:** If, else and elif statements

## Resources: 
- **Code Academy Cheatsheets:** Honestly they serve both as a great reminder and as one page introductory how-to.   
https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3/modules/learn-python3-control-flow/cheatsheet
- **Mosh YouTube Python Tutorials:** Watching someone else is usually a really good intro to a concept before trying it out yourself. There are tons of video courses on Linkedin Learning, Coursea etc. I recommend Mosh for intro concepts because they are free and concepts are organized into chucks making it easy to find what you are looking for. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTjRvDozrdlxj5wgH4qkvwSOdHLOCx10f
- **$$ Code Academy course "Learn Python 3":** The exercises are good opprotunity to type something yourself after you watched a video on the basics. Everything is done on the website which means you won't have any experience running Python on your computer. To get the most out of it, try running the mini guided projects in Jupyter Labs, Spyder etc. https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3
- **W3Schools Practice Exercises:** Test your knowledge once you think you have mastered a concept. Good free, choose your own adventure prep before a quiz. https://www.w3schools.com/python/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_ifelse2
- **$ O'Reilly Textbook "Python for Data Analsis:** Explains how to setup Jupyter, and key packages including NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib. You need to take the jump to Jupyter or another IDE and use packages if you are ever going to write anything on your own. There are a bunch of other textbooks for learning Python basics. I recommend this since O'Reilly since the familar formating will be nice when trying to learn higher level concepts from some of their other textbooks. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075X4LT6K/?coliid=I1J7OQP44GOXUE&colid=J71FGVZU2MCC&psc=0&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it
- **$$$ O'Reilly Online Portal:** At $49 a month this is an expensive way to learn the basics. Buy one of their books on Amazon, if you like the format and are committed to going through 3+ concept books a month it's worth the investment when you are passed the basics. 
- **$ Code Combat** Great bonus resource for practicing syntax dozens of times. It's a kids game so you won't be copying any of the code to future projects but it does help increase your speed. Backwoods Forest is the first level with if statements, and you will have to beat the lower level beforehand. https://codecombat.com/play

  
## Pro-Tip: Summary Info 

#### It's always a best practice when uploading a new dataframe for analysis to run a couple summary functions.
