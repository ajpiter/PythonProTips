## Variables & Dataframes 

#### The building blocks of Python. 
1. **Variable** is a container for storing data. 
2. **Dataframe** a two dimensional labeled data structure. Conceptually think of a spreadsheet. 

## Data Types 

#### Different types of inputs have different behavior in python

1. **Floats:** Real numbers include decimals 
2. **Intergers:** Whole counting numbers  
3. **String:** Text surrounded by "quotes"
4. **Boolean:** is True or False 
5. **Lists:** A collection of values stored as List = ['a', 'b', 'c'] or ListOfList = [(1, 2, 3), ('a', 'b', 'c')]
6. **Dictionary:** Uses keys to reference values, {'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3} 
7. **Numpy Array:** Similar to a list but must be one data type. Allows for calculations over entire array. 
8. **Set:** 
9. **Tuples:**

## Functions & Loops 

#### Common commands that make executing code easier. 
1. **Functions:** A block of code that preforms a specific task  
2. **Loops:** Iterate over a dictionary, list, tuple, set or string. 
3. **Conditional Statements:** If, else and elif statements
  
## Pro-Tip: Summary Info 

#### It's always a best practice when uploading a new dataframe for analysis to run a couple summary functions.
