## Loops 
Loops allow you to repeat a block of code without having to retype it.  

- **For Loops:** Loops that let us move through each item in a list. 
- **While Loops:** Loops that keep going until we tell them to stop. 
- - **While True:** Runs until the statement is no longer TRUE. Code after a While TRUE loop will never run, because the program is constantly runing through the loop. 
- **List Comprehensions:** Loops that create new lists

### Loop Keywords 
- **break:** You can stop a for loop from inside the loop by using break. When the program hits a break statement, control returns to the code outside of the for loop.

### Functions in Loops 

- **range()** Complete a task a number of times specified in the range()
