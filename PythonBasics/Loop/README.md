## Loops 
##### Loops allow you to repeat a block of code without having to retype it. 

### Loop formating, to be inside of a loop a command must be indented 
keyword: 
  argument 
  argument 

### While TRUE 
##### Runs until the statement is no longer TRUE. Code after a While TRUE loop will never run, because the program is constantly runing through the loop. 

##### Continues to move and then attack 
While TRUE: 
  hero.moveRight()
  hero.attack("Enemy")
