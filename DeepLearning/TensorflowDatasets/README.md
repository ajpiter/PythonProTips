# Tensorflow Datasets 

[Tensorflow has builtin datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/overview) that could be used in numerous Deep Learning practice projects. Types of Datasets include: 
- Audio 
- Graphs 
- Image
- Object Dection 
- Structured 
- Summarized 
- Text
- Translate 
- Video 
- Vision Language 

## Resources to Learn More About Datasets in Tensorflow 

Goal is to first load a dataset, and then format into a tensorflow data pipeline. Tensorflow datasets make the process much easier. 

- [Tensorflow Datasets Guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/overview) Google Colab Notebook that walks through how to use tf.data.Dataset. TFDS provides a collection of ready-to-use datasets for use with TensorFlow, Jax, and other Machine Learning frameworks. 
- [Tensorflow Data Pipeline Guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data) Google Colab Notebook that walks through how to setup data in Tensorflow.
