# Deep Learning Models  

Neural Networks are Deep Learning Models that take input(s) X, and predict output(s) y. Usually by goinf through a hidden layer, recurrent layer and/or kernals.

As shown in the image above from Towards Ai, there are numerous types of nerural networks. Below I outline some of the more common models, and their typical use cases.  

## Dense Neural Network
In a dense neural network, every node in a hidden layer is connected with every node in the preceding layer (either input or previous hidden layer) and are the most common type of neural networks.  

- [Dense Network, Single Hidden Layer](https://github.com/ajpiter/PythonProTips/blob/master/DeepLearning/Dense_Network_Single_Hidden_Layer.ipynb): An example of the simplest of neural networks with a single input, a single hidden layer, and a single output. 
- [Dense Network, Single Hidden Layer with Two Nodes](https://github.com/ajpiter/PythonProTips/blob/master/DeepLearning/Dense_Network,_Hidden_Layer_with_Two_Nodes.ipynb): An example of how to calculate the value of hidden layers and outputs with mathmatical formulas. 
- [Image Classification Greyscale Faishon MNIST](https://github.com/ajpiter/PythonProTips/blob/master/DeepLearning/Image_Classification_Greyscale_Fashion_MNIST.ipynb): Image Classification using a single hidden layer to process greyscale images into one of 10 categorical outputs. Notebook is part of [Udacity's Intro to TensorFlow for Deep Learning](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud187) course.
- [Udacity Celcuis to Fahrenheit](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/courses/udacity_intro_to_tensorflow_for_deep_learning/l02c01_celsius_to_fahrenheit.ipynb): An step by step walk through on how to create a neural network with a single input layer, a single hidden layer and single output.  

## Sequential Neural Network 
Nodes in a sequential neural network are only connected with a single node in the proceeding layer, making them the simplest neural networks. 
- [Digit Recoginition Model](https://github.com/ajpiter/PythonProTips/blob/master/DeepLearning/DigitRegonitionModel.py) Given an image of a number as an input, predicts which number it is as an output. Created as part of Udacity's Deep Learning Nano Degree. 

## CNNs Convolutional Neural Networks

CNNs are often used for image classification problems. 
- [CNN Image Classification Greyscale Faishon MNIST](https://github.com/ajpiter/PythonProTips/blob/master/DeepLearning/CNN/CNN_Image_Classification_Greyscale_Fashion_MNIST.ipynb): Image Classification using a CNN layer to process greyscale images into one of 10 categorical outputs. Notebook is part of [Udacity's Intro to TensorFlow for Deep Learning](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud187) course.
- [CNN Image Classification Color Cats & Dogs Without Augmentation](https://github.com/ajpiter/PythonProTips/blob/master/DeepLearning/CNN/Color_Image_Dogs_Cats_Wo_Augmentation.ipynb): Image Classification using a CNN layer to process color images into binary output. Notebook is part of [Udacity's Intro to TensorFlow for Deep Learning](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud187) course.
- [CNN Image Classification Color Cats & Dogs With Augmentation](): Image Classification using a CNN layer to process color images into binary output. Where augmentation creates additional inputs by cropping or rotating orginal images in the dataset. Notebook is part of [Udacity's Intro to TensorFlow for Deep Learning](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud187) course.

## RNNs Recurrent Neural Networks 
RNNs are a type of sequence model that is often used in 
1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
2. Speach Recoginization
3. Time Series
