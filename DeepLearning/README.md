# Deep Learning Models  

Neural Networks are Deep Learning Models that take input(s) X, and predict output(s) y. Usually by goinf through a hidden layer, recurrent layer and/or kernals.

As shown in the image above from Towards Ai, there are numerous types of nerural networks. Below I outline some of the more common models, and their typical use cases.  

## Dense Network
- [Dense Network, Single Hidden Layer](https://github.com/ajpiter/PythonProTips/blob/master/DeepLearning/Dense_Network_Single_Hidden_Layer.ipynb): An example of the simplest of neural networks with a single input, a single hidden layer, and a single output.

## CNNs Convolutional Neural Networks 
- CNNs are often used for image classification problems. 

## LSTM Models 

## RNNs Recurrent Neural Networks 
- RNNs are a type of sequence model that is often used in Natural Language Processing and speach recoginization.
