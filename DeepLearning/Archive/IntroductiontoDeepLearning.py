#Introduction to Deep Learning 

#Simple Linear Regression model, is based on the outcome being the sum of indivdual parts. 
#The Linear Regression model does not identify the interactions bewteen the indivdual parts. 

#Example of a Linear Regression Model trying to determine the number of transactions a customer at a bank will make. 
#Indivudal parts taken into consideration are Age, Bank Balance, Retirement Status. 
#A graph depicting a linear regression model of possible transactions would include a 
#x axes with bank balance
#y axes with predicted transactions 
#parell line segments of retired and not retired customers 

#Neural networks account for interactions and would allow the lines, of retired and not retired customers to be unparrell
#Deep Learning is the use of neural networks 

#Diagram for a neural network 
#Far Left - Input Layer Representing Predictive Features (Age, Income, Number of Accounts)
#Center - Hidden Layer made up of Nodes representing an aggregation of data from the input layer
#Far Right - Output Layer Representing the Predections (Number of Transactions) 

#Nodes in the hidden layer add to the models abilities to caputre interactions. 
#The more nodes we have the more interactions we capture.
